TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
"""There were alot of questions yet I am still unsure of how many there are exactly. I wish they would be numbered to make things a little easier. Overall it was quite difficult because I actually didn't finish. Perhaps the tutors could teach us in a more visual way and also delve more into these long strings, functions etc. Some of them are seem so advanced that even the tutorials I watch don't even cover how the hell to complete them. Also the weather question's sign up was broken, the website would not register my account sign up""".
