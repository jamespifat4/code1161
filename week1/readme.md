TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
*MUST READ* - Originally I had week 1's work completed in the due time, however upon doing week 2's work, I discovered I had forked CODE1161'S 2017 class, hence I had the wrong homework. I had to delete all my saved work and redo it. 

Week 1 - I had trouble understanding why certain programs wouldn't work due to anothe rprgrm/software not being downloaded or certain steps not being completed. It took me a while to figure this issue but peers were friendly to guide me to complete the main tasks. I still have minor issues as it seems I have made 16,000 changes on VsCode, ready to be committed on github desktop. *UPDATE* I have fixed this issue by deleting all git downloads and removing the location of the downlaod to an outer and own folder.
