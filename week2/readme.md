TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Week 2 - I completed Week 2's task but only after some serious explaining. I didn't undertand where to start at all. However, know I am confident in where to start and how to and what words to use and what they mean. I feel happier now AHAH.
