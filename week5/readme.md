TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
"""This week's exercises weren't as bad as week 4. Week 1 I believe I finished, but again the questions are clear, so maybe I missed one. But that exercise was fairly easy"""

"""UPDATE - I just learn't for some bloody reason Week 4 Ex1's tasks were meant to be typed into Week 5??? Why is this? Just make it easier and keep it in their respective weeks or MAKE IT CLEAR please that this is how it's meant to be done""".
