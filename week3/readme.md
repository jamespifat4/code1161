TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
"""This week's homework was a the most difficult so far, having not being taught loops clearly made it a nightmare. We need a much more in depth lesson to give us guidance in the steps needed to complete a question. Even an exmaple that's not the homework. Would be appeciated."""
